## Lindemann Electronics

Welcome to **Lindemann Electronics**, the future home of my services as a repair technician, tech enthusiast, and lifelong learner.

This site is being coded from scratch as both a personal challenge and a demonstration to my beginning passion in web devleopment. Eventually, this platform will have dynamic content, backend capabilities, SEO optimizations, and social media integrations. It should be a platform for people to learn more about my services and who I am as a person.

## About the Project

`lindemannelectronics.com` is a professional website in progress â€” built to:

- Showcase repair and refurbishing services for electronic devices.
- Share ongoing tech projects and personal skill development.
- Serve as a portfolio hub for future web development and social media endeavors.

I am not a web developer by any means, but I want to embrace the learning experience by writing this code myself. The point is to challenge myself and stick through something without taking the easy way out.
